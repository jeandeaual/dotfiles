# GIMP gimprc
#
# This is your personal gimprc file.  Any variable defined in this file takes
# precedence over the value defined in the system-wide gimprc:
# /etc/gimp/2.0/gimprc
# Most values can be set within GIMP by changing some options in the
# Preferences dialog.

# Snap to the canvas edge by default in new image windows.
(default-snap-to-canvas yes)
# Snap to the grid by default in new image windows.
(default-snap-to-grid yes)

# Sets the minimal number of operations that can be undone. More undo levels
# are kept available until the undo-size limit is reached.
# Default: 5
(undo-levels 32)
# Sets an upper limit to the memory that is used per image to keep operations
# on the undo stack. Regardless of this setting, at least as many undo-levels
# as configured can be undone.
# Default: 64M
(undo-size 256M)
